# script-toolbox
php and powershell code to auto create HTML web interface based on powershell scripts. You can then populate fields and execute script with that as input on a windows server.

This code was written for a specifc organization I worked for and needs to be cleaned before posting. Check back soon or open an issue telling me you're interested in seing the code to speed this along.
